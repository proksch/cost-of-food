# Inspiration
The Earth Overshoot Day is there to remember that we consume more than we can our planet can produce. This happens in many sections of our daily life. People might or might not be aware that our consumption habits are sub-par, but the real impact remains mostly hidden. We want to be a starting point for creating awareness for the real cost of food consumption. We want to be the starting point for people to receive detailed ecological footprint information via online channels.

People spend much time on social media, engaging with a broad range of topics, including food topics, as it can be seen on varying communities and hashtags. We want to use their passion for those pictures and enrich those with awareness creating information about the ecological footprint. With Foodprint, we offer everyone the opportunity to make a sustainable choice when selecting their everyday food.

## What it does
Foodprint automatically recognizes what food is displayed on a picture and shows the ingredients and an assumption of their respective average quantity per portion. With this data, we calculate the ecological Foodprint data, by counting up the used amount of ingredients. Users can enrich this data, which then can be fed back to the learning algorithm. For a better understanding, we display the Water and Energy Consumption in easily understandable metrics.

The social media integration (Browser Add-On) gives the possibility to easily get information for a picture as well as enhance the data set of Foodprint. Ingredients and their amount can be easily updated. The information will then be posted to the respective picture, firstly shown on the social picture shaing platform "Instagram". Following many users' typical use case, many people might be able to get better informed and awareness rises about ecological good and bad food choices. In the long run we expect people to be more savvy and make better food choices to help saving our planet. A link in the comment section will link to a more detalied information page.

This page contains common Food Dishes and different information about their ecological foodprint. As a plus we offer a set of recipes with a low ecological foodprint to help everyone choose a sustainable dish to cook.

Future developments would include more sophisticated data sets and information on how to substitute high ecological foodprint products such as meat.

## How we built it
Think... Talk... Code... Run... Test... Eat... Don't sleep...

## Collaboration of a cross-functional team:
- Product Owner
- Business Analyst
- Fullstack Developer
- Software Engineering Researcher

## Challenges we ran into
* New technologies challenged us in new and old ways.
* Leaving the massage room.
* The trade-off: workshops, sleeping or coding?

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* It works!


## What we learned
* Teamwork rocks!
* Image recognition really needs a big data set.

## What's next for FOODPRINT
Train the neuronal network with more data, to recognize even more dishes and their respective ingredients, to properly calculate the ecological footprint of a dish. With that we not only enforce the creation of awareness, we also create a large data-set that of food-image recognition that could be used by other companies, in the areas of fitness, cooking, food producing, restaurants and others.
